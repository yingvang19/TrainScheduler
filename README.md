# TrainScheduler

I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It is not working, but I will work on some more in the future. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
 
This app uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, BootStrap, and Moment.js. Enjoy the app by adding your own favorite train names. All Aboard!!
